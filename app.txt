VADERSentiment :
The Python code for the rule-based sentiment analysis engine. 
Implements the grammatical and syntactical rules described in the paper, 
incorporating empirically derived quantifications for the impact of each 
rule on the perceived intensity of sentiment in sentence-level text. 
Importantly, these heuristics go beyond what would normally be captured in 
a typical bag-of-words model. They incorporate word-order sensitive 
relationships between terms. For example, degree modifiers 
(also called intensifiers, booster words, or degree adverbs) 
impact sentiment intensity by either increasing or decreasing the intensity. 

The sklearn.feature_selection module implements feature selection algorithms. 
It currently includes univariate filter 
selection methods and the recursive feature elimination algorithm.
